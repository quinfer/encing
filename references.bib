Practical Bayesian data analysis, like all      data analysis, is an iterative process of model building, inference, model      checking and evaluation, and model expansion. Visualization is helpful in      each of these stages of the Bayesian workflow and it is indispensable when      drawing inferences from the types of modern, high dimensional models that      are used by applied researchers.}},
