Further, we exploit British panel data, which includes an extensive range of biomarkers.

Equally important, it provides a clear improvement over use of GARCH models feasible for use with a large number of assets, such as constant conditional correlation, dynamic conditional correlation, and their extensions, with respect to out-of-sample density forecasting. A generalization to a mixture of multivariate Laplace distributions is motivated via univariate and multivariate analysis of the data, and an expectation–maximization algorithm is developed for its estimation in conjunction with a quasi-Bayesian prior. It is shown to deliver significantly better forecasts than the mixed normal, with fast and numerically reliable estimation.

Surprisingly, little analytical work has addressed the credit evaluation process and, specifically, the need of the lending authority to assimilate information in order to assess the likelihood of repayment. The purpose of this note is to construct a model of lender utility maximization which explicitly accounts for the assimilation of information as an input to the decision‐making process. Aigner and Sprenkle [2] were the first to develop a model of optimal short run lending behavior in the context of variable information, an objective that this note clearly shares. However, Aigner and Sprenkle's research results were constrained by their use of an ad hoc information function. We employ a Bayesian approach to the information demand decision which allows the lender to revise the expected return and the variance of the return with the acquisition of additional customer information. Our method of analyzing the information demand decision is an application of Kihlstrom's work [11] on the theory of information demand. In section I, the role of information in adjusting the expected utility associated with each lending decision is established. In section II, we derive the lender's optimal loan size. The basis for section III is a proof of the existence of an optimal demand for information and an analysis of this demand in regard to other important variables. In section IV, we summarize the major conclusions relating to credit extension and the demand for information about the credit worthiness of a loan applicant. 1979 The American Finance Association",,2,0,,,,undefined,

However, several of the major issues are sufficiently important to justify reemphasis. We have presented a sequential methodology that is better than procedures currently used in finance LDF studies. This methodology refrains from presenting meaningless results and emphasizes the difference between cross-validation tests and interteraporal-validation tests. This latter point is especially important since many finance LDF studies have confused ex post discrimination with ex ante prediction. We also suggested a more appropriate measure of the explanatory power of the LDF variables than the commonly reported standardized coefficients and we stressed total efficiency as a preferred measure of performance over either of the two ancillary conditional measures of efficiency. In addition, we showed the role that prior probabilities play in both establishing test hypotheses and cutoff LDF scores. In particular we demonstrated that for research questions addressed to populations with extremely assymetric priors it will be very difficult to improve on chance classification and sample results may give a misleading impression of usefulness. Last, we presented a Bayesian evaluation approach. Its main advantages are that it explicitly accounts for the costs of misclassification and it is more decision-oriented than classical analysis. © 1975, School of Business Administration, University of Washington.
