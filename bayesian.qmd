## Introduction to Bayesian Statistics

In this section, we delve deeper into the fundamental concepts of Bayesian statistics, building on top of the brief introduction given earlier. We explain the main terminologies involved, along with graphical representations and calculations associated with them. This helps establish a strong foundation for further study of Bayesian methods in finance.

### Terminologies and Definitions

1. **Probability**: Probability is a numerical measure representing the chance or likelihood that a particular event occurs. Its value ranges from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certainty). Mathematically, it satisfies certain rules called Kolmogorov's axioms. For discrete variables, $p(X)$ represents the summed probabilities over all possible outcomes of $X$. Similarly, for continuous variables, $p(X)$ denotes the integral evaluated over all possible outcomes of $X$, often expressed as a probability density function (PDF).

2. **Parameter**: In statistics, parameters refer to unknown quantities characterizing a population. These could include population means, variances, proportions, correlation coefficients, and others. Our goal typically involves making informed statements about these parameters based on observed data from a sample drawn from the larger population.

3. **Statistic**: Statistic refers to a quantity derived from sample data. Unlike parameters, statistics represent known values calculated directly from observed data. Common examples include sample means, medians, percentiles, correlations, and regression coefficients.

4. **Prior**, $\pi(\theta)$: Before observing any data, a prior belief regarding the likely range of plausible values for the parameter(s) ($\theta$) of interest is specified in the form of a probability distribution, referred to as the prior distribution. This expresses prior knowledge, assumptions, or beliefs held before seeing any data. When little information exists, one opts for relatively uninformative priors to avoid biasing conclusions unduly. On the contrary, when substantial domain knowledge is available, highly informative priors can incorporate such expert judgments effectively.

5. **Likelihood**, $f(x \mid \theta)$: Given a set of fixed parameter values, likelihood quantifies the probability of obtaining the observed sample data ($x$). In essence, it acts as a bridge connecting hypothesized parameter values with actual evidence contained in the data. By varying the parameter values, we derive corresponding likelihood values, revealing which combinations align best with the data at hand.

6. **Posterior**, $p(\theta \mid x)$, also denoted as $\pi(\theta \mid x)$: Once the prior and likelihood have been defined, Bayes' rule allows us to update our initial belief system (prior) with the newly acquired empirical information (likelihood), leading to the formation of a refined, updated belief encapsulated in the posterior distribution. Formally stated, the posterior captures the conditional distribution of parameters ($\theta$), conditioned on the observed data ($x$). Mathematically, Bayes' rule states:
$$
\underbrace{p(\theta \mid x)}_{\text{{Posterior}}} = \frac{\overbrace{f(x \mid \theta)}^{\text{{Likelihood}}}\times \overbrace{\pi(\theta)}^{\text{{Prior}}}}{\int f(x \mid \theta)\cdot \pi(\theta)\mathrm{d}\theta}.
$$
Note that the denominator serves as a scaling constant ensuring proper normalization of the posterior distribution.

7. **Marginal likelihood** or **Evidence**, $f(x)$: Also referred to as the model evidence, marginal likelihood arises due to the need to integrate out nuisance parameters from the full joint distribution while computing the posterior distribution. Marginal likelihood plays a crucial role in comparing competing models since higher marginal likelihood implies better overall fit of the model to the data.

8. **Conjugacy**: Conjugacy describes the property where the functional forms of the prior and posterior belong to the same parametric family of distributions. Such relationships simplify computations significantly, especially in cases where closed-form solutions exist. Many well-known pairs of conjugate distributions facilitate straightforward mathematical manipulations, thereby rendering analytical expressions feasible even without resorting to computationally intensive algorithms.

Next, we discuss several aspects of prior distributions, explaining various ways to specify them and understand their impact on posterior inferences.

### Specifying Prior Distributions

When choosing a prior distribution, multiple options exist depending on whether we possess substantive domain knowledge or merely vague hunches concerning the likely range of plausible values for the parameters. Accordingly, we categorize prior distributions into broad classes—informative and uninformative priors.

1. **Uninformative Priors**: Often chosen when lacking sufficient prior knowledge about the parameters, uninformative priors aim to minimize influence on posterior inferences by assigning equal weight across wide swaths of potential parameter values. Some commonly employed choices include uniform distributions spanning large domains, Jeffreys priors, reference priors, or improper flat priors. However, extreme care must be taken while selecting uninformatively because seemingly innocuous decisions can still exert disproportional impacts on subsequent analyses. Moreover, misuse or misunderstanding of such priors may lead to flawed conclusions and biased inferences.

2. **Weakly Informative Priors**: Alternatively, weakly informative priors strike a delicate balance between imparting minimal guidance and conveying subtle hints regarding reasonable bounds encompassing probable parameter values. Typically, these take the form of mildly peaked distributions exhibiting wider spread than conventional informative priors but narrower dispersion relative to uninformative alternatives. Prominent instances include Gaussian distributions centered around zero with moderately small variances, Laplace distributions concentrated near origin with modest scales, or half-Cauchy distributions truncated below zero having moderate scale factors. Although not strictly equivalent to uninformative priors, weakly informative counterparts generally yield similar qualitative patterns in posterior distributions while mitigating risks posed by arbitrarily assigned uninformative priors.

3. **Informative Priors**: Based on ample prior information stemming from domain experts, historical records, previous studies, meta-analytic reviews, or elicitations, informative priors assume central roles in guiding posterior inferences towards desirable regions reflecting genuine underlying phenomena rather than mere artifacts resulting from poorly chosen priors. Ideally, such priors convey accurate representations of reality anchored firmly in reliable foundations backed by sound scientific reasoning and rigorous documentation. Popular choices include Gaussian distributions centered around sensible locations endowed with appropriate precisions, Bernoulli distributions manifesting believable success probabilities, Poisson distributions embodying realistic rate parameters, or Dirichlet distributions exemplified by meaningful mixture weights. Nevertheless, caution ought to be exercised when invoking strongly informative priors since excessive reliance on untested premises can potentially obscure valuable signals hidden within the data itself.

### Impact of Prior Distributions

As previously mentioned, the choice of prior distribution heavily influences subsequent inferences derived from posteriors. To gain intuition behind this phenomenon, consider the following aspects affecting prior sensitivity:

1. **Data Volume**: As the volume of available data increases, the contribution of the prior diminishes considerably owing to overwhelming empirical evidence overshadowing initially espoused convictions embodied within the prior. Essentially, as more data become accessible, the posterior converges toward the maximum likelihood estimator, irrespective of the adopted prior. At extremes, this situation translates into asymptotic insensitivity wherein the ultimate choice of prior becomes inconsequential.

2. **Model Complexity**: With increasing complexity introduced via sophisticated structural dependencies, intricate latent constructs, or nested hierarchies, the necessity for judicious prior selection amplifies accordingly. More elaborate architectures demand greater scrutiny vis-à-vis priors precisely because they harbor numerous interconnected components susceptible to being swayed excessively by arbitrary selections. Therefore, thoughtfully crafted priors remain indispensable tools for stabilizing convergence behavior, preventing overfitting, promoting identifiability, and facilitating principled interpretations rooted in defensible epistemological grounds.

3. **Prior Strength**: Depending on the degree of conviction conveyed through the prior, stronger priors tend to dominate posteriors whenever confronted with scanty data containing limited signal strength. Conversely, feeble priors carrying negligible persuasion recede into oblivion rapidly once substantial amounts of informative data emerge. Hence, careful calibration of prior strengths ensures harmonious fusion of prior knowledge and empirical discoveries, culminating in mutually reinforced syntheses reflecting augmented wisdom instead of discordant contradictions.

To conclude this day, we explore a concrete example of Bayesian inference employing a textbook scenario featuring a binomial likelihood combined with a beta prior. Specifically, suppose a coin has been flipped five times, yielding four heads ("successes"). Using a beta prior with hyperparameters $(\alpha,\beta)=(3,3)$, we calculate the posterior distribution governing the head tossing propensity, $\theta$, for this hypothetical coin. Finally, armed with the posterior, we compute relevant summary statistics shedding light on the revised understanding of the coin's fairness after witnessing the experimental outcome.

### Binomial Example

Assume a coin flip trial comprising five independent events, each producing heads ("successes") with unknown true proportion $\theta$. Suppose four heads appear during the trials. Let us now determine the posterior distribution governing $\theta$ given this data.

First, define the likelihood function, assuming a binomial process generating the observed sequence of heads and tails. Then, choose a suitable beta prior encoding our ignorance regarding the coin's inherent bias. Next, invoke Bayes' rule to obtain the desired posterior distribution, subsequently deriving pertinent summary statistics describing the revised assessment of $\theta$.

Binomial likelihood:

$$
f(D|\theta)=\binom{5}{4}\theta^{4}(1-\theta)^{1}=5\theta^{4}(1-\theta)^{1},
$$
where $D=\{"HHHTT"\}$ signifies the observed sequence of coin flips.

Beta prior:

$$
\pi(\theta)=\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}\theta^{\alpha-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta-1}=\frac{\Gamma(6)}{(\Gamma(3))^{2}}\theta^{2}(1-\theta)^{2},
$$
with hyperparameters $(\alpha,\beta)=(3,3)$. Note that the beta distribution constitutes a flexible family accommodating diverse shapes determined by its hyperparameters. Furthermore, it serves as a natural conjugate prior for the binomial likelihood, streamlining derivations.

Now, utilizing Bayes' rule, we find the posterior distribution:

$$
\begin{align*}
p(\theta|D)&=\frac{f(D|\theta)\cdot\pi(\theta)}{\int_{0}^{1}f(D|\theta)\cdot\pi(\theta)\mathrm{d}\theta}\\
&=\frac{5\theta^{4}(1-\theta)^{1}\cdot[\theta^{2}(1-\theta)^{2}/B(3,3)]}{\int_{0}^{1}[5\theta^{4}(1-\theta)^{1}]\cdot[\theta^{2}(1-\theta)^{2}/B(3,3)]\mathrm{d}\theta}\\
&\propto\theta^{4}(1-\theta)^{1}\theta^{2}(1-\theta)^{2}\\
&\propto\theta^{(4+2)-1}(1-\theta)^{(1+2)-1}\\
&\sim\text{Beta}(\color{red}{(4+2)}, \color{green}{(1+2)}).
\end{align*}
$$
Thus, the posterior follows a beta distribution with updated hyperparameters $(4+2,1+2)=(6,3)$.

Finally, we compute several useful metrics summarizing the posterior distribution:

* Mean: ${\mathbb{E}}(\theta)=\frac{(4+2)}{(4+2)+(1+2)}=\frac{6}{9}$.
* Mode: ${mode}(\theta)=\frac{6-1}{9-1}=\frac{5}{8}$.
* Variance: ${Var}(\theta)=\frac{(6)(3)}{(9)(10)}=\frac{18}{90}$.

Interpreting these results, we observe that the posterior mean indicates slightly elevated odds favoring heads over tails, whereas the mode suggests an approximate $62.5\%$ chance of encountering heads. Additionally, the relatively small variance highlights reduced uncertainty surrounding $\theta$ post-observation compared to the original ambiguity embedded within the diffuse beta prior. Overall, the cumulative effect of the observed data coupled with the carefully chosen beta prior successfully refines our appreciation of the coin's fairness, thus corroborating the efficacy of Bayesian methods in updating prior beliefs given novel empirical evidence.

With this comprehensive treatment of Bayesian basics, we proceed to examine essential facets of Bayesian hypothesis testing and model comparison in upcoming sections. Armed with enhanced familiarity with core principles, learners shall soon acquire proficiency in navigating increasingly intricate landscapes populated by myriad models vying for attention amidst vast seas of tantalizing data waiting to be explored and understood. Stay tuned!
