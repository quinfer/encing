## Introduction

Welcome to Advanced Financial Analytics, designed for aspiring financial professionals seeking to master cutting-edge quantitative methods and technologies for navigating complex financial landscapes. Today's volatile and uncertain financial climate demands proficiency in sophisticated analytical techniques, fueling the necessity for this comprehensive course covering time series econometrics, Bayesian methods, and artificial intelligence (AI). This chapter introduces essential terminology, provides a historical perspective on financial analytics, describes the importance of integrating economics, statistics, and AI, and outlines the course objectives.

## Background

Historically, financial analytics primarily focused on static methods, such as ratios, yield calculations, and cash flow analysis. However, mounting pressure to remain competitive in a technologically advancing world led to the gradual evolution of financial analytics, giving rise to the current era dominated by quantitative and qualitative techniques. Modern financial analytics caters to diverse stakeholders, including investors, regulators, rating agencies, and corporations. Increasingly stringent regulations coupled with intensified competition compelled financial institutions to adopt more rigorous analytical approaches, culminating in widespread utilization of time series econometrics, Bayesian methods, and AI.

## Importance of Integrating Economics, Statistics, and AI

Finance comprises three primary pillars: economics, statistics, and AI. Economic principles serve as the cornerstone of sound financial practice, forming the bedrock upon which successful financial endeavors rely. Statistical thinking reinforces economic intuition, enabling financial professionals to ascertain cause-and-effect relationships among pertinent variables and measure uncertainty. Finally, AI augments human cognitive capacities, transcending conventional analytical limits imposed by laborious and time-consuming manual techniques. Employing AI in financial analytics affords several advantages, namely enhanced predictive capabilities, automatic feature identification, and adaptive learning.

## Course Objectives
